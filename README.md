# mycroft-skill-lets-talk
A skill for MycroftAI that replies to various greetings

DESCRIPTION:

This Mycroft skill is a modification of the npr-skill by eward.
Basically, all I have done is added intents for "Good Morning,"
"Good Afternoon," "Good Evening," and "Good Night."

USAGE:

Say any of the following:

  * good morning
  * good afternoon
  * good evening
  * good night

NOTE:

Currently, only the GoodMorning intent works.  I have *no*
idea why the other intents aren't working so if someone
can fix this I'd *really* appreciate it!
